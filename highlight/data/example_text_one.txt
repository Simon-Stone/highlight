Urban land teleconnections in the United States: A graphical network approach

Cities influence land use change on neighboring and distal areas through sociopolitical or infrastructural connections between urban and non-urban regions, termed teleconnections. Here, we quantify and map urban land teleconnections in the US using information theory in concert with graphical networks. Evidence of teleconnections relied on long-term (1950 –2016) changes in urban land cover and urban population intensity in urban areas relative to land dynamics in other cities and rural lands, located both proximate and distal to each city.

We find that optimal urban-rural land network complexity and network size ranged dramatically and depended on the information theory measure and variables under consideration. City-city networks were very large, suggesting the complex and simultaneous effects of globalization on cities. However, we also find that proximate urban-rural networks are small and influenced directly by individual cities, though each city may, in turn, be influenced by complex teleconnections with other cities. Distal rural areas providing agricultural commodities were characterized by decreasing agriculture land use yet increasing agricultural production intensity. Hence, distal rural commodity areas may support multiple cities, incurring increased land stress in those areas.

Our results suggest that changes in population intensity, rather than urban land cover alone, induce more numerous effects on proximate and distal rural lands, as well as other cities. Predictive models of teleconnection strength explained 4.5% to 98% of variation in teleconnection measures and suggested that rural land characteristics were equally, if not more, important than variables characterizing city land dynamics. This indicates that local dynamics in rural areas are potentially more important drivers of land change relative to teleconnections with cities.

The methodological approach presented in this paper holds promise in incorporating teleconnections in land use and land cover change modeling efforts, providing important considerations for later studies on emissions modeling, economic supply chains, and future land-use planning.Spatially proximate estimates of demand (e.g., energy footprints) and supply (e.g., watersheds) have given rise to Central Place Theory and distance-decay modeling of urban impact on surrounding land change (Brinkley, 2018). Urban land expansion studies have focused on fixed geographical locations and proximate drivers of land conversion from non-urban to urban uses (Angel et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2007). Models forecasting future urban extents are governed by place-based forcings of urbanization pressure, such as spatial proximity to existing urbanizing areas (Terando et al., 2014) and socio-economic pressures (Deng et al., 2008, 2010). These models utilize projections of population density and macroeconomic factors (Seto et al., 2012), land suitability and spatial proximity (Terando et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; McKee et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2019), and a combination of multi-scale macro-drivers and spatially explicit factors (Gao & O'Neill, 2019; Chen et al. 2020).

The urban land teleconnection (ULT) framework shifted the traditional urban-land paradigm towards the conceptualization of processes that link urban land change in multiple non-adjacent geographies (Seto et al., 2012). In recent years, studies examining urbanization through a coupled human-natural systems lens have increased considerably (Kapsar et al., 2019), especially the consideration of systemic relationships between cities and regions falling well outside urban boundaries (DeRolph et al., 2019; McManamay et al., 2017). Telecoupling studies aimed at informing sustainability have been numerous (Liu, 2019), seeking to map the indirect environmental implications of commodity supply chains, including CO2 emissions (Davis et al., 2014; Davis et al., 2011), virtual water trade and stress (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012), and biodiversity loss (Lenzen et al., 2012). Examples of studies incorporating ULT include urban-induced economic shifts in agricultural commodity networks (Jiang et al., 2013; Tsuchiya et al., 2015), agricultural land responses to urban tourism (Lee et al., 2019), peri-urban and distant land changes from urban demands in construction materials (Chiu et al., 2019), land consequences of shifts in global diets (Kastner et al., 2012), and implications of upstream urbanization and resource use on land-aquatic interfaces (Syvitski et al., 2009).

The drivers that establish and influence linkages remain difficult to define, ranging from sociopolitical processes, ecosystem services, commodity flows, or infrastructural linkages (Meyfroidt et al., 2013). Relatively few ULT studies have explicitly quantified land change in one area resulting from telecoupled processes occurring in a geographically separated region (Turner et al., 2007). The complexity is two-fold: first, it requires establishing viable telecoupled relationships between urban areas and non-adjacent geographies and, secondly, translating the exogenous pressures into drivers of land change at a local level. Additionally, establishing empirical telecoupled urban land linkages are challenged by the availability and scale-mismatches of long-term data on socio-economics and land change (Turner et al., 2007). Developing predictive land telecoupling relationships to inform urban land forecast models are even less likely.

One potential solution to overcome these challenges is through a combined statistical and graphical approach where the evidence of causality between urban dynamics in one area and land change in another can be examined. This approach is completely scalable and bypasses the need for demarcating all mechanisms behind upstream.Transfer entropy is a robust approach for detecting non-linear causal connections in time series and can be efficiently incorporated into LULCC frameworks. We quantify, map, and predict ULTs in the conterminous US using a method combining graphical networks with information-theoretic modeling. The US is characterized by expansive urban land development, including highest per capita urban land areas and largest changes in total urban extent over the past 30 years. 

We discuss evidence of teleconnection network structure in the US and present details of the modeling approach for extension to other countries and regions. Long-term trends in LULCC, population dynamics, and agricultural commodity production are used to measure land telecoupling between urban and rural areas. We explore the evidence of causality between rural land cover change and socioeconomic-land dynamics in urban areas, located both proximately and distally to each other. Additionally, we examine inter-dynamic land relationships among cities, located both distally and proximally. 

Aside from rates of urban land development, we primarily focus on agricultural land cover and production intensity because urban expansion has typically resulted in widespread loss of crop or pasture lands. These relationships have implications for understanding future stress on land-food production systems that stem from the influence of urban expansion policies on distal commodity exchange. To determine the potential for incorporating ULT in future land use and land cover change models and to identify important factors governing teleconnections, we construct models to predict teleconnection strength based on human population size, economics, and landscape characteristics.(Fig. 2d, f) and quantified using different variables (Fig. 2g-h). In most cases of urban expansion within the US, agriculture land is the predominant land cover converted to urban use (Fig. 2g-h). Our proximate urban-rural land teleconnections are based on the influence of population and urban land dynamics in cities on urban and agricultural land cover in rural areas (Fig. 2g-h). Distal urban-rural land teleconnections were based on food commodity flows between cities and supporting agricultural regions. Over 50% of the US landscape is used for agricultural purposes (Nickerson et al., 2015); hence, land dynamics stemming from urban-rural food commodities provide a sufficient example of our methodological approach.

We quantified the presence and strength of teleconnections using information theoretic measures reliant upon temporally extensive (1950 –2016) empirical patterns in land, population, or commodity dynamics. Variables used in our analysis are summarized in Table 1. Teleconnection strength was measured as causality (transfer entropy) or correlation (Bayesian posterior) between chronological land dynamics for each pairwise node combination.

2.2. Building urban land teleconnection networks
Defining urban land teleconnection networks required establishing differences between urban and rural nodes. We elected to use the US Census Bureau's definition of urban areas, defined as a “continuously built-up area with a population of 50,000 or more” (USCB (US Census Bureau), 1994). One limitation is that our analysis does not consider teleconnections between urban and peri-urban lands. Urban boundaries needed to be static to keep total land budgets constant and maintain consistency in how urban and non-urban land changes were calculated. Therefore, we used US census-defined urban area extents defined for 2020.

For the conterminous US, our analysis included 484 urban areas. Rural entities (n 1564) were then considered portions of counties that excluded the 2020 urban areas. Fig. 1 provides a conceptual overview of the methodological approach for mapping and quantifying urban land teleconnections.(b) Denver, and (c) Los Angeles, California a shared teleconnection with Denver. (d) Denver's proximate urban-rural and distal urban-rural neighborhoods. (e) Denver's proximate urban-rural neighborhood and differences in land cover. (f) Two rural areas directly serving Denver's food flow network. (g) Developed and agricultural land changes in county 08123, one of Denver's proximate rural areas. (h) Changes in agricultural land and agricultural production intensity in county 01033, one of Denver's direct food sourcing areas.

Proximate urban-rural land networks were constrained by empirically defined distance thresholds. Distal urban-rural land commodity networks were constrained to only those with established agricultural commodity supply chain connections. The strength of pairwise relationships in the teleconnection network were inferred from positive or negative associations between land dynamics in two nodes. We summarized long-term (1950 to 2016) trends in several metrics: developed land cover (DL), development intensity (DI), agricultural land cover (AG), and agricultural production intensity (PI). DL was summarized for both urban and proximate rural areas, whereas DI was summarized for only urban areas. AG was summarized for both proximate and distal rural areas, whereas PI was only summarized for distal rural areas (i.e., those participating in food flow network).DI is calculated as persons per km2 of developed land in urban areas, providing an indication of the model of urban expansion, specifically intensive versus extensive growth. Global gridded 1-km2 quinquennial population estimates were available from 2000 to 2020 and backcasted decadal estimates available from 1970 to 2000. Population for 1950 was estimated using a combination of linear backcasting modeled from population over time (1970 to 2000) for each urban area and 1950 county population values as a ceiling value. For missing years of population data, non-linear spline interpolation was used to fill in those gaps.

For PI, historical production values and land acreage for 13 crops from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Census were compiled for years 1950, 1954, 1959, 1964, 1969, 1972, 1978, 1982, 1989, 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012. PI for each crop was calculated by dividing each production value by acreage planted for that crop. Values were then standardized from 0 to 1 using the following formula: Xi = (xi - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin). For each county and year, standardized values for all crops were averaged into a composite PI score.

Temporal vectors of land, population, or production intensity were compiled for each node. Transfer entropy (TE) is a non-parametric information theoretic measure for the direct transfer of information from one random process to another, used to infer causality among two different random variables and is well suited for network analyses.Translating Shannon's Transfer Entropy (TE) into directed information from Xi to Yj can be calculated using the following equation:

TEXi→Yj = MI(Yj1CXiCτ⊘YjCτ) / MI(Yj1CYjCτ)

where MI is mutual information calculated using a kth nearest neighbor approach based on the joint distribution of the two variables, Xi, τ ⊘Yj, τ (Servadio & Convertino, 2018; Behrendt, Dimpfl, Peter and Zimmermann, 2019). TE is ideal for detecting causal relationships between two random variables (Kaiser & Schreiber, 2002), and the predictive ability of one variable on another (Gencaga, Knuth, & Rossow, 2015).

As a more liberal measure of potential urban-urban or urban-rural relationships, Bayesian inference for linear regression was used. For each pairwise node-to-node (Xi and Yj) comparison, posterior means of slope coefficients (B) were calculated, measuring the influence of Xi on Yj.

Both TE and Bayesian posterior means were calculated for the following pairwise relationships in temporal patterns: 1) DL in urban areas vs. other urban areas, 2) DI in urban areas vs. other urban areas, 3) DL in urban areas vs. rural areas, 4) DL in urban areas vs. AG in rural areas, 5) DI in urban areas vs. DL in rural areas, 6) DI in urban areas vs. AG in rural areas, 7) DL in urban areas vs. PI in rural areas, 8) DI in urban areas vs. PI in rural areas.

To optimize urban teleconnection networks, cumulative TE (CTE) was calculated as:

CTE = ΣNn=1TEXiCn→YjCn×VXiCYiCn

Where TE values are summed for all N pairwise internodal relationships participating in the network, depending on V, a binary indication of whether the nth pairwise internodal relationship participates in the network contingent.

To optimize Bayesian networks, incremental values of B were used to restrict nodes and edges participating in each network. For each subset, Bayesian networks were constructed including the 8 sets of variables presented earlier. To understand the explanatory power of each network, Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) were calculated, where maximum values indicate the optimum information explained.Strength could be predicted from a series of predictors, including DL, DI, population, and real income for urban areas, and DL, AG, population, and PI for rural areas. Pairwise distances (km) separating each urban-urban or urban-rural area were measured. We used a binary indication of proximate urban-rural networks, "Development Boundary", and "Agriculture Boundaries" as binary indications of teleconnections with evidence of commodity supply chains. We also used percent agriculture production consumed by each urban area as a predictor of urban-rural teleconnection strength. Boosted regression tree models and random forests were used for modeling and assessing the relative importance of each predictor variable.

3. Results
3.1. Urban-rural and urban-urban networks
Fig. 3 visualizes examples of urban-urban and urban-rural networks in graphical space. Non-optimized networks included 1564 total rural areas, 1501 of which were bounding or proximate to urban areas and 202 of which were distal agriculture production zones. Total potential edges included 3912 pairwise urban-rural relationships, 2809 of which were between urban areas and proximate rural areas and 1123 of which were between urban areas and distal agriculture production areas. Urban-urban teleconnections totaled 234,256 urban-urban pairwise relationships. Each graphical network in Fig. 3 includes both urban-urban and urban-rural teleconnections to provide a holistic perspective of urban land teleconnections in the US.

Teleconnection strength was assessed using both transfer entropy (TE), a measure of causality, and Bayesian posteriors, a measure of correlation. Fig. 3 shows graphical networks depicting urban (blue) and rural (orange) areas as nodes and the edges (grey lines) as teleconnections.Transfer entropy (TE) values showed considerable variation among the variables used in network relationships. TE was highest for urban-rural relationships between development intensity (DI) and production intensity (PI) and urban-urban relationships involving the influence of DI in one city on another (Fig. 4a). Bayesian posteriors were consistently positive for relationships between developed land (DL) in urban areas and DL and PI in rural areas, and predominantly negative for relationships between DL and agricultural land (AG) between urban and rural areas (Fig. 4a). 

Optimal network complexity ranged dramatically and depended upon the variables under consideration and the information theory measure (Fig. 5a-b). Urban-rural networks optimized by TE ranged from 120 to over 500 nodes and from 100 to 443 edges (Figs. 5c, 4e). In contrast, networks optimized by Bayesian posteriors ranged from 107 to almost 2000 nodes with 96 to over 3700 edges (Fig. 5d, e). Average neighborhood size for most urban-rural networks ranged from 2 to 4 nodes. 

In contrast to urban-rural networks, urban-urban networks optimized by TE were far more complex than Bayesian networks and included between 5569 and over 16,000 edges. Bayesian urban-urban networks did not include all cities and edges ranged from 926 to 1450. Average neighborhood size for urban-urban networks was 34 cities. 

Examples of networks in graphical space illustrate the variable complexity of teleconnection structure, which primarily depends on the number of network relationships between urban and rural entities (Fig. 3). Optimized graph network structure was influenced by the land use and population variables used to inform teleconnections and the information theoretic measures used to measure teleconnection strength (Fig. 3). Graphical networks further demonstrate that TE and Bayesian posteriors explain different information, ultimately resulting in divergent structures of spatial relationships and inter-dependencies, measured as causality versus correlation (Fig. 3).In this study, urban-rural teleconnections were analyzed using Bayesian information criteria. The spatial extent of teleconnections was visualized, providing a holistic view of teleconnection structure (Fig. 6). Distal urban-rural networks were found to be extensive and driven by urban-induced changes in agricultural land cover and crop production intensity (middle and bottom panels, Fig. 6). Differences in teleconnections were evident in physical space (Fig. 6). Networks informed through Bayesian posteriors were more inclusive of urban-rural teleconnections, increasing the complexity and size of urban-rural neighborhoods (Fig. 6).

Measures of teleconnection strength did not display strong correlations with predictor variables; however, variables characterizing rural areas tended to have as strong or stronger influence on TE and Bayes posterior values than the characteristics of urban areas (Fig. 7). City population and distance between urban and rural areas displayed little correlation with measures of network strength. Real income, city DL, and DI displayed stronger correlations for measures of network strength related to DI. For TE and Bayes posterior values indicating changes in DL and AG, rural land population, developed land area, and agricultural land area displayed strongest correlations.

Model performance ranged considerably, explaining 4.5% to 98% (median 47%) of the variation in network strength, depending on the metric and the tree-based model employed (Table S1, Fig. S1). On average, models explained more variation in Bayesian posteriors than transfer entropy measures (Table S1, Fig. S1). For urban-rural teleconnections, boosted regression trees and random forests had comparable performance. However, random forest models were superior to boosted regression trees in modeling urban-urban teleconnections (Table S1, Fig. S1). Relative importance of predictor variables mirrored the results of correlation analyses, with all variables having measurable contributions to model performance (Fig. S2).(b) Correlation matrix comparing TE and Bays posteriors in their measurement of relationships for different metrics describing urban-rural relationships.

Urban land teleconnections in the United States are complex and not necessarily geographically affiliated. Optimal networks included all cities and provided evidence for over 16,600 inter-urban land teleconnections, which is only 7% of the total possible urban-urban relationships. On average, each US city shares 34 telecoupled relationships with other cities, while most proximate urban-rural neighborhoods are smaller, with 2-4 nodes in size. About 50% of all rural areas in the US display teleconnections with cities. More teleconnection relationships are observed as an outcome of population intensity than developed land cover. This suggests that land use and land cover changes in rural areas are influenced by population changes in a single city and indirectly influenced by population dynamics in numerous cities acting upon the nearest city hub.Major agriculture-producing rural areas of the US show a slightly different pattern of telecoupling with urban areas. According to Lin et al. (2019), over 3000 US counties serve as food producers and over 3000 are food consumers. However, when all food flows were constrained to only direct urban destinations, only 202 counties producing agricultural resources were included and each of these rural areas, on average, provide food commodities directly to only 6 cities. Only 32% of these urban-rural commodity linkages showed evidence of urban-induced LULCC (Fig. 9d), resulting in distal urban-rural neighborhoods averaging less than 2 teleconnections each. 

Imperial County California is among top-ranking hay, vegetable, and livestock producing counties in the US (USDA, 2017). Measures of transfer entropy indicate that all 29 commodity linkages between Imperial County and cities provide evidence of urban-induced land cover change. Maricopa County Arizona, however, is also among top-ranking crop production areas in the US (Duval et al., 2018), but only 4 of 61 potential urban-agriculture commodity linkages are statistically supported via urban-rural land cover changes. 

Food supply chains are extensive, involving numerous intermediate steps in commodity transformation for final end use (Konar et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019). Many rural areas source raw products to other rural areas for processing and packaging and shipment to major distribution centers prior to arrival in cities, whereas other rural areas source raw or manufactured products directly to cities. Land dynamics in some agricultural-commodity-producing rural areas may be resistant to land and population dynamics within individual cities since they are serving numerous large-scale markets. 

Teleconnection network size and complexity were dependent upon the information theoretic measure used to measure teleconnection strength between nodes. The choice of metric (Bayesian or transfer entropy) depends on the objectives behind understanding and quantifying urban land teleconnections. The path dependencies conceptualized by Seto et al. (2012) in the ULT paradigm tend to align ideologically more with a causal perspective of urban lands inducing changes elsewhere and, presumably, more land changes stemming from cities with larger socioeconomic power.In teleconnection networks, cumulative TE was calculated separately for cities based on (a) proximate and (b) distal urban-rural teleconnections and for counties based on (c) proximate and (d) distal urban-rural teleconnections. Several tree-based models explained significant variation (F60%) in urban-rural agriculture teleconnections and strong performance (F95%) in modeling inter-urban dependencies in developed landcover (random forests only). Models predicting urban-induced changes in agriculture production intensity tended to show higher performance than other urban-rural models. 

One surprising observation was the higher relative importance of variables characterizing destination nodes, particularly rural endpoints of urban-agriculture teleconnections. Population size and the amount of agriculture land or developed land in rural areas were more important in explaining trends in teleconnection strength than characteristics of cities, such as population size and real income. These results highlight important features of urban network inter-dependencies and resulting land teleconnections. First, rural areas may display strong land "inertia", i.e., resistance to individual exogenous pressures. Second, more numerous yet less-populated entities (most of rural areas) may play more significant structural roles in networks than large urban areas.The study reveals the structure of urban land teleconnections (ULTs) in the conterminous US, finding evidence that almost 500 of the largest cities participate in inter-dependent networks influencing each other's land and population dynamics. The majority of rural areas also participate in urban-rural networks, with major US agricultural producing areas responding to simultaneous pressures from many urban areas and showing the strongest teleconnections that can be predictably modeled.

The methodological approach has limitations, such as being statistically based rather than mechanistically based, and measuring teleconnections as univariate relationships between each node without considering systemic upstream influences. The approach is flexible and could be used in conjunction with material flows or emergy synthesis approaches.

The US-case study application and methods employed hold promise for expanding lines of inquiry in land use and land cover change (LULCC) modeling. Expanding graphical networks to higher spatial granularities would further evaluate the potential for incorporating teleconnections into future LULCC models. Another area of research is understanding how teleconnections result in landcover change to influence city policies and minimizing supply chain impacts on distal landscapes. Models of city expansion and morphology have significant influences on transportation, energy demand, and environmental footprints.Research on the influence of city expansion via intensification versus extensification on land teleconnections is needed to understand systemic implications of urban decision making on other urban or rural landscapes. Resource demands and material flows in cities are generally consistent with urban scaling laws (Kennedy et al., 2015) or correlates of socioeconomic power (Creutzig et al., 2015). Applications of these methods could elucidate whether urban land teleconnections are mere manifestations of material flux or reflect nuances of city decision-making.Duval, D., Bickel, A.
